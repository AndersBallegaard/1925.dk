        <h1>The Twelve Networking Truths</h1>
        <hr>
        <div >
            <div class="p-3"><h2>1 - It Has To Work.</h2></div>
            <div class="p-3">
                <h2>2 - No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority, you can't increase the speed of light.</h2>
            <h3>    2A - (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you can't make a
                baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed this up
                *might* make it slower, but it won't make it happen any
                quicker.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>3 - With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
                not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
                are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
                as they fly overhead.</h2></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>4 - Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
                understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
                networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
                builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
                network.</h2></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>5 - It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems
                into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
                this is a bad idea.</h2></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>6 - It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
                the problem to a different part of the overall network
                architecture) than it is to solve it.
        </h2>
        <h3>6A - (corollary). It is always possible to add another level of
            indirection.</h3></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>7 - It is always something</h2>
                <h3>7A - (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two (you can't
                    have all three).</h3></div>
            <div class="p-3">            <h2>8 - It is more complicated than you think.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>9 - For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.</h2>
                <h3>9A - (corollary) Every networking problem always takes longer to
                    solve than it seems like it should.</h3></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>10 - One size never fits all.</h2></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>11 - Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
                a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.</h2>
            <h3>11A - (corollary). See rule 6A.</h3></div>
            <div class="p-3"><h2>12 -  In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
                is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
                away.</h2></div>
